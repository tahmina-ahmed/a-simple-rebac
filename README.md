A Simple Relationship Based Access Control Model
Our simple ReBAC model only considers one type, symmetric relationship between users. Authorization policy would be able to check existence of multilevel relationship. Only three specific commands are defined for the model add relationship, delete relationship and access. Each command has a configurable authorization policy which has the capability to check existence of relationship between two specific users upto a certain level and an optional update statement.
